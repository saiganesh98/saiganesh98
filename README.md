Hi there 👋
I'm Sai Ganesh (He/Him), a Senior Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience in Automation Testing and AI-driven solutions.

🔭 I’m currently automating everything but my coffee—still working on that!


🌱 Always learning, because even code needs to grow. “Learning never exhausts the mind.”

👯 Let’s collaborate on projects that need a touch of automation magic! "Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."

💬 Ask me about Automation Frameworks, Competitive Programming, or why my tests always pass on the first try... (Just kidding, that's the dream!)

📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer!
